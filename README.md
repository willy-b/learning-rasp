Solving little problems in Restricted Access Sequence Processing (RASP), a language designed to help one in "Thinking Like Transformers" (title of Weiss et al 2021 paper which introduced it). Hoping to use RASP for a final project in a class this year (2024 Nov) so trying to keep myself accountable by working through problems in a repo. 

Programs in this folder can be interpreted using Weiss et al 2021's RASP interpreter at https://github.com/tech-srl/RASP .
